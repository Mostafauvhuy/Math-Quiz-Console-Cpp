📝 Introduction

The Math Quiz System is an advanced C++ console-based application that allows you to teach students mathematics, generate random questions with different difficulty levels, track students’ answers, and automatically calculate results.

This project reflects your growth journey from writing simple code to building a larger system with student management and multi-level quizzes.
